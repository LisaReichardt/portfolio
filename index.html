          </div>
          <p>
            Over a two-year period, I worked on the conception and design of a graphical user interface for a mobile
            emergency ventilator for WEINMANN Emergency Medical Technology. The project focused on creating a reliable,
            intuitive interface for use in high-stress emergency environments while aligning closely with the existing
            brand identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The early phases of the project were strongly driven by conceptual UX design. Understanding users, usage
            contexts, and system constraints formed the foundation for all subsequent decisions, ensuring that
            functional complexity was addressed before visual solutions were defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the increased display size, UI design was considered early on as part of the conceptual work rather
            than as a final styling step. Interaction patterns, layout principles, and information hierarchy were
            explored in parallel with UX concepts, laying the groundwork for a scalable and consistent interface system.
          </p>
          <p>
            As lead designer and project manager, I was responsible for the overall design direction and the development
            of a modular visual language. Together with my colleague Jim Brummer and in close collaboration with
            development, I established a Figma library intended to serve as the foundation for future product
            generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project followed a waterfall-oriented process with continuous validation across disciplines. Through
            iterative concept reviews and usability testing, assumptions were challenged and refined, resulting in a
            well-founded solution that balances usability, functionality, and long-term scalability.

          <p>
            Between 2019 and 2023, I worked on the conception and design of the
            next generation of premium cavity and cooling appliances for Gaggenau.
            The aim of the collaboration was to translate the brand’s values into
            a consistent digital experience and to establish a timeless, distinctive
            user experience across the new product family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall responsibility for UX/UI direction and client coordination was
            shared with my colleague Kristina Wisch. While we jointly led the project
            on a strategic level, I took responsibility for planning, budgeting, and
            team coordination for <a
              href="https://www.gaggenau.com/de/geraete/kaeltegeraete/vario-kaltegerate-serie-expressive"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cooling series</a>. Core UX/UI concepts and designs
            for both cavity and cooling product lines were developed in close
            collaboration with Jie Guo, supported by additional designers throughout
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cooling series was developed at an early stage and served as the
            conceptual foundation for subsequent products. This required a constant
            system-level perspective, ensuring that interaction principles and design
            decisions would scale across future appliances with very different functional
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was carried out in an agile setup and involved close
            interdisciplinary collaboration with Gaggenau’s internal design team
            as well as several development partners. Working within a well-orchestrated
            Scrum process gave me a deep understanding of design as an integral part
            of product development—from early concept phases through to implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new product family has since been successfully launched.
            Looking back, this project shaped my understanding of strategic
            design, collaboration, and long-term thinking, and I am grateful to
            have been part of a design-driven process that demanded both precision
            and creativity.

            DESIGNA develops and delivers integrated hardware and software solutions for parking management systems
            worldwide, ranging from individual applications to large-scale infrastructures such as airports and
            city-wide parking areas. Within this context, the Designa Suite was conceived as a central control platform
            for managing, monitoring, and maintaining complex parking operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project aimed to create a responsive web-based control center for desktop and tablet that allows
            different user groups to efficiently oversee systems, processes, and potential issues. Based on personas and
            user journeys, the focus was on building a flexible interface that adapts to varying contexts,
            responsibilities, and operational environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key challenge was the design of a dashboard capable of translating complex data into clear, actionable
            information. The goal was to create an intuitive management system that remains transparent under high data
            density while supporting advanced features such as customization and predictive maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution was developed through a series of requirement workshops, information architecture explorations,
            and iterative design phases, resulting in a coherent interaction concept and a clearly structured interface.
            Particular attention was paid to scalability, ensuring that the system functions equally well for single
            parking facilities and large, distributed infrastructures.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the project, a comprehensive design system and Figma library were created to support both desktop
            and tablet applications. In parallel, a refined brand language was developed, establishing a consistent
            visual and interaction foundation for future DESIGNA products.
