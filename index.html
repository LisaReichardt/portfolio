          <p>
            Over a two-year period, I worked on the conception and design of a graphical user interface for a mobile
            emergency ventilator for WEINMANN Emergency Medical Technology. The project focused on creating a reliable,
            intuitive interface for use in high-stress emergency environments while aligning closely with the existing
            brand identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The early phases of the project were strongly driven by conceptual UX design. Understanding users, usage
            contexts, and system constraints formed the foundation for all subsequent decisions, ensuring that
            functional complexity was addressed before visual solutions were defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the increased display size, UI design was considered early on as part of the conceptual work rather
            than as a final styling step. Interaction patterns, layout principles, and information hierarchy were
            explored in parallel with UX concepts, laying the groundwork for a scalable and consistent interface system.
          </p>
          <p>
            As lead designer and project manager, I was responsible for the overall design direction and the development
            of a modular visual language. Together with my colleague Jim Brummer and in close collaboration with
            development, I established a Figma library intended to serve as the foundation for future product
            generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project followed a waterfall-oriented process with continuous validation across disciplines. Through
            iterative concept reviews and usability testing, assumptions were challenged and refined, resulting in a
            well-founded solution that balances usability, functionality, and long-term scalability.

            Between 2019 and 2023, I worked on the conception and design of the
            next generation of premium <a href="https://www.gaggenau.com/de/geraete/kaeltegeraete/#media-layer-7"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              coffee machine</a> for Gaggenau.
            The aim of the collaboration was to translate the brand’s values into
            a consistent digital experience and to establish a timeless, distinctive
            user experience across the new product family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall responsibility for UX/UI direction and client coordination was
            shared with my colleague Kristina Wisch. While we jointly led the project
            on a strategic level, I took responsibility for planning, budgeting, and
            team coordination for the refrigerators. Core UX/UI concepts and designs
            for all three product lines were developed in close
            collaboration with Jie Guo, supported by additional designers throughout
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The refrigerators was developed at an early stage and served as the
            conceptual foundation for subsequent products. This required a constant
            system-level perspective, ensuring that interaction principles and design
            decisions would scale across future appliances with very different functional
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was carried out in an agile setup and involved close
            interdisciplinary collaboration with Gaggenau’s internal design team
            as well as several development partners. Working within a well-orchestrated
            Scrum process gave me a deep understanding of design as an integral part
            of product development—from early concept phases through to implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new product family has since been successfully launched.
            Looking back, this project shaped my understanding of strategic
            design, collaboration, and long-term thinking, and I am grateful to
            have been part of a design-driven process that demanded both precision
            and creativity.

          <p>
            One of my first clients at HID was DESIGNA, an internationally operating company specializing in integrated
            hardware and software solutions for parking management. I initially developed concepts and layouts for the
            user interfaces of entry and exit terminals as well as payment machines. A key challenge was aligning the
            design with the existing brand identity while ensuring optimal readability on outdoor displays under varying
            weather conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on this, I developed a concept for a web-based control center for managing parking facilities.
            Based on personas and user journeys, the focus was on creating a flexible interface that adapts to different
            usage contexts, responsibilities, and operating environments. The goal was to reduce complexity and design a
            unified dashboard that delivers relevant information tailored to specific user groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept was developed through requirements workshops, information architecture analyses, and iterative
            design phases, resulting in a coherent interaction concept and a clearly structured user interface. The
            project subsequently served as a key case study and strategic foundation for further product development.

            Bread & Soda is a UX/UI mobile app case study I created within one week as part of the 'UX/UI Web
            Development with AI' course at CodeAcademy. For the assignment, we were free to choose the app concept, and
            I decided to
            design a playful and intuitive app that enables children and teenagers to order their daily school meals
            with ease. The focus was on making the experience simple, approachable, and fun, while still supporting
            clear and structured user flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project covered the full design process, from research and competitor analysis to design system
            creation, prototyping, and final presentation. Designed for iPhone 13 Mini, the app includes onboarding,
            registration, core ordering flows, profile management, and chat features. This case study challenged me to
            work fast, make confident design decisions, and translate different requirements into a clear and engaging
            mobile experience.

            Meet Meeple is a UX/UI case study I created as part of my CodeAcademy course, focused on designing a
            responsive website for an indoor and outdoor games platform. The project started with a collaborative group
            phase, where we defined the core concept, user problems, personas, competitor insights, and overall
            structure. In the individual phase, I translated this foundation into a final UI design for the homepage and
            three additional screens, aiming to create an engaging and intuitive experience that inspires people to
            discover and play more games.

            The social component of eating together is one of the most important in a person's life. When suffering from
            food allergy, this ritual can lead to lifelong anger, frustration and social isolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of my master's thesis was to identify the problem, understand its social relevance, focus on the
            individual, rethink social patterns, and explore new behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a focus on interface and industrial design and a strong human-centered approach, I developed a vision
            of a tool that facilitates the lives of food allergy sufferers and offers them a perspective on inclusion in
            the social event of having a meal together.

            The project started with a strong foundation through the collaboration with the team of the start-up „The
            Intuaid Project“, supported by clear requirements and a shared vision. The goal was to design a first aid
            app for sea rescue scenarios that provides reliable guidance and immediate orientation in emergency
            situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within an interdisciplinary team of medical and interface design students, I was primarily responsible for
            the UI design while also contributing significantly to the conceptual phase. Through rapid prototyping and
            iterative evaluation, multiple approaches were explored, discussed, and gradually consolidated into a
            coherent interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final design prioritizes speed, clarity, and safety under pressure and adverse weather conditions. A
            visually reduced layout, clearly separated navigation, a prominent panic button, and a one-action-per-screen
            principle minimize cognitive load and support confident decision-making in critical moments.

            The honey bee is one of our most important livestock for the preservation of our global biodiversity. My
            bachelor thesis aims to provide this precious creature with a species-appropriate and minimally invasive
            cultivation by the beekeeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the first sketch to the final design, my path was a process of designing and discarding. The focus was
            always on the beekeeper as the user, but much more on the bee as a component of the consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interdisciplinary examination of tradition and the future perspective of a newly growing profession has
            significantly shaped the result.
