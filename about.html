      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h1>
        I am Lisa Reichardt, a senior UX/UI designer with 9+ years of experience. I am passionate about shaping digital
        products with an industrial design background. Currently I’m open to work.
      </h1>
      <p>
        Design does not emerge by chance; it is the result of careful observation, deep understanding, and critical
        questioning. Complexity motivates me, and I design with empathy for the user as well as a strong passion for
        design and technology. I particularly enjoy immersing myself deeply in new contexts in order to develop
        sustainable and value-creating solutions. I am a true team player, as ideas grow through changing perspectives,
        exchange, and collaborative thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I successfully completed my Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Design (B.A.) at
        <a href="https://en.muthesius-kunsthochschule.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muthesius
          University
          of Fine Arts and Design</a> in Kiel in 2014. Since then, I have been especially interested in the digital side
        of design,
        which led me to pursue an additional Master’s degree in Interface Design. During my studies, I also completed a
        semester abroad in Austria at the <a href="https://www.kunstuni-linz.at/en/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Arts Linz</a> and gained my first professional experience
        through an internship at <a href="https://www.intuity.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuity
          Media Lab</a> in Stuttgart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my years of study, I received numerous awards, including the <a
          href="https://www.staatspreis.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bayerischer-staatspreis/Staatspreise/2014/08_Katalog/Staatspreis_2014_Katalog_1.pdf"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Bavarian State Prize for Emerging Designers</a> and the <a
          href="https://muthesius-kunsthochschule.de/2014/10/07/preisregen-fuer-muthesianerinnen/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          James Dyson Award National</a>
        in 2014, as well as the <a href="https://ifdesign.com/en/winner-ranking/project/mima/149836" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          iF Design Talent Award</a> in 2015 for my bachelor’s thesis. For my master’s
        thesis, I was awarded the <a href="https://design-center.de/de/Mia-Seeger-Preis-Ergebnisse-432.html"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Mia Seeger Preis</a> in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, I worked for seven years as a UX/UI Designer at <a href="https://human-interface.de/en"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          HID Human Interface Design</a> in Hamburg, where I
        gained extensive hands-on experience across all phases of interface and interaction design, including research,
        concept development, prototyping, design guidelines, and quality assurance. During this time, I worked on a wide
        range of projects, from large-scale product developments involving embedded systems to web and app applications,
        as well as pitch decks and case studies. Over time, I took on responsibility for several clients and also worked
        as a Lead Designer and Project Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the closure of the HID agency, I joined <a href="https://www.intuity.de/en/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuity
          Media Lab</a> in 2023 and, together with several
        colleagues, founded a new location in Hamburg. There, I developed a comprehensive design system in Figma for the
        client Weinmann and led several extensive user testing initiatives. Since artificial intelligence has achieved a
        major breakthrough, my work has been strongly shaped by an exciting new think-tank culture focused on the
        symbiosis between design, humans, and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my journey is far from over. I have now fulfilled my wish to return to my hometown of Kiel and am open
        to exciting digital challenges ahead.
