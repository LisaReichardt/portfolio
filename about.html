        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h1>
          I am Lisa Reichardt, a senior UX/UI designer with 9+ years of
          experience. I am passionate about shaping digital products with an
          industrial design background. Currently I’m open to work.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Design does not happen by chance, but is the result of precise
          observation, deep understanding, and critical questioning. As an
          industrial and interface designer, I design with attitude, passion,
          and curiosity for people and context.
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly enjoy working at the interface between digital
          technology and physical products with the aim of creating experiences
          that are relevant, add value, and are future-proof. For me, trends and
          new technologies are not gimmicks, but tools for shaping real
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complexity motivates me. To this end, I acquire in-depth domain
          knowledge and use it to develop sustainable solutions. The best ideas
          emerge in a team through a change of perspective, exchange, and
          collaborative thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to hop on my road bike and explore new areas
          and spending time with my family.
